    "## Introduction: \n",
    "    Harmful algal blooms result when excess nutrients (Phosphorous and Nitrogen) loading in water bodies combine with slow moving water to create blue green algae which combine into Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs). There are many different types of blooms. Almost all have a negative impact on the surrounding environment, and many can be harmful to humans.\n"

    "## Hypothesis:\n",
    "    One of the main factors in HAB formation is energy availability. In the wake of climate change, nations have taken moves to curb emissions and lower global temperatures. Are these steps readily obvious when viewing HAB occurence rate? Evapotranspiration is another process reliant on water, would the rate of this over time over change? And how will the potential changes compare to those of the HABs? Energy is a major source needed in facilitating both ET and HAB occurence, so how might the rates of these compare over the years?"

If positive, can identify any potential measures that have been taken in NY or nationally that could potentially explain these (either measure targetting HABS directly, or sources such as energy influx or nutrient influx), these measures also should probably be referenced first in the hypothesis or introduction. If negative, explain why any potential measures aren't working. If no measures were found, try and identify why the results appear negative, and maybe brainstorm any measures that could be taken to deal with the identified apparent cause. If the results are inconclusive (varying or differing rates in HAB occurence, precip, or discharge, for example) explain what is explainable, try to explain reasons why other results may be inconclusive\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of the results, the limitations will need to be discussed. HABs throughout the state of NY were analyzed, but precip and discharge data was only looked at for a single site. These are intended to charecterize the ET and water movement, but there are issues with using it for the whole state. The HAB data only goes back to 2012, and the practices that led to the increase in HAB occurence was very likely before that, so the complete picture on HAB data is likely not available."
